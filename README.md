A machine learning-powered fraud detection system implemented in Python with:
- **Random Forest Classifier** for transaction analysis
- **Interactive Flask dashboard** for visualization
- **Google Colab integration** for easy deployment

## üöÄ Features
- **Real-time fraud prediction** on credit card transactions
- **Web dashboard** with:
  - Transaction distribution charts
  - Fraud/legitimate transaction counters
  - File upload capability (.csv)
- **99.9% model accuracy** on test data

## üì¶ Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FraudDetectionSystem.git
2. Install dependencies: 
pip install -r requirements.txt

üîß Usage (Google Colab)
1. Upload the notebook to Google Colab
2. Run all cells sequentially
3. Access the dashboard via the generated ngrok URL

üíª Code Overview
Key Components:
- Data Preprocessing
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

- Model Training:
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=150, max_depth=10, 
                             random_state=42, class_weight='balanced')
- Flask Endpoints:
@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    # Handles real-time prediction requests

üìä Dataset
Uses the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset:

- 284,807 transactions (492 fraudulent)
- 30 anonymized features (V1-V28, Amount, Time)
